they believed the apocalypse was imminent.

他们相信世界末日即将来临。

Since the end of World War II faith in technological marvels has blinded many people to the reality that life is still an uncertain endeavor at best. 

二战以来，科技信仰让人们忽略了一个事实，即生活是不确定的。

then 2020 happened: borders were slammed shut, store shelves were stripped bare, global supply lines.

到了2020年，边境被关闭，商店货架被清空，全球供应链被切断。

So what is a prepper? A prepper is a person who lives in the real world and recognizes that life can be turned on its head in an instant. should something happen to disrupt their cushy lives, they’re ready.

什么是准备者？准备者生活在真实的世界，他们知道世界瞬息万变，所以他们准备好了。

### Useful Skills

Many people have become so reliant on technology and more specifically, electricity, that they panic if the power goes out even for a short time (4). But what if there were long term disruptions to the power grid, or social order breaks down for whatever reason and you’re forced to leave your home? What would you do?

* Would you know how to build a fire to cook food and stay warm?

* Would you know how to build a basic shelter?

* Would you know how to navigate using a paper map and a compass?

* Do you know basic first aid?

* Do you know how to hunt, fish or trap?

* Do you know any self-defense techniques?v

All these and more are skills most preppers will cultivate because, as 2020 showed us, you never really know what’s around the corner.
