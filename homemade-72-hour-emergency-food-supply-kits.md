What about military-style rations, for example MREs? These have some good points. They have a long shelf life. They’re sealed in tough packaging, and they’re not too heavy. Everything in them can be eaten cold, with no preparation. They also pack in a lot of calories – around 1,200 per meal. 

军用口粮保质期很长,可以冷着吃，它们被密封在坚固的包装中，而且不太重。它们还含有大量卡路里——每餐约 1,200 卡路里。
